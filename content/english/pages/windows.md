##### Technical Details

1. **The particularly deep glass recess**: with 28 mm glazing rebate height for optimum isothermal flow prevents, among other things, the formation of unwanted condensation on the inside
2. **Structural reinforcements and perfectly fitted steel reinforcements**: provide additional dimensional stability - even for large, statically demanding windows
3. **The classic design**: with elegant shapes, slightly rounded edges and narrow face widths blends harmoniously into any architectural style
4. **Stop seal system**: with 2 sealing levels for excellent wind tightness, optimum protection against driving rain and high sound insulation up to sound insulation class 5
5. **Highest VEKA quality**: Class A profile in accordance with DIN EN 12608 with an outer wall thickness of 3 mm and 2.7 mm walls in the rebate and connection area (tolerance ±0.2 mm in each case)
6. **76 mm basic installation depth**: ideal for effective thermal insulation, universally applicable for new buildings and renovations
7. **Highly insulating multi-chamber geometry**: for maximum energy efficiency and best Uw thermal insulation values of up to Uw = 0.81 W/(m2K) [with Uf = 1.2 W/(m2K), Ug = 0.5 W/(m2K), ψg = 0.03 W/(mK)]
