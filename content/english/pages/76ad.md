With a basic installation depth of 76 mm, SOFTLINE 76 AD combines the advantages of the 70 and 82 mm system worlds for the perfect balance between energy and cost efficiency. SOFTLINE 76 AD windows save valuable heating energy and create a pleasant living climate. It is even possible to use special functional glazing for enhanced sound insulation and burglary protection.

With SOFTLINE 76 AD, two sealing levels with stop gaskets provide reliable long-term protection against noise, cold, moisture and draughts.
