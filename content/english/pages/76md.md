Three sealing levels with a central seal effectively protect against noise, cold, moisture and draughts in the SOFTLINE 76 MD system. As a multi-chamber system with a basic installation depth of 76 mm, SOFTLINE 76 MD combines the advantages of the 70 and 82 mm system worlds for the perfect balance between energy and cost efficiency.

Even large glass surfaces are no problem with the slim yet economical design of SOFTLINE 76 MD.

## Technical Details

1. **The particularly deep glass recess**: with 28 mm glazing rebate height for optimum isothermal flow prevents, among other things, the formation of unwanted condensation on the inside
2. **Structural reinforcements and perfectly fitted steel reinforcements**: provide additional dimensional stability - even for large, statically demanding windows
3. **The classic design**: with elegant shapes, slightly rounded edges and narrow face widths blends harmoniously into any architectural style
4. **Center seal system**: with 3 sealing levels for excellent wind tightness, best protection against driving rain and high sound insulation up to sound insulation class 5
5. **Highest VEKA quality**: Class A profile in accordance with DIN EN 12608 with an outer wall thickness of 3 mm and 2.7 mm walls in the rebate and connection area (tolerance ±0.2 mm in each case)
6. **76 mm basic installation depth**: ideal for effective thermal insulation, universally applicable for new buildings and renovations
7. **Highly insulating multi-chamber geometry**: for maximum energy efficiency and best Uw thermal insulation values of up to Uw = 0.76 W/(m2K) [with Uf = 1.1 W/(m2K), Ug = 0.5 W/(m2K), ψg = 0.03 W/(mK)]
