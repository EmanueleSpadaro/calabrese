Modern PVC-U windows from the SOFTLINE 82 AD profile system optimize the energy balance of any building. They combine outstanding energy-saving properties with extreme durability, stability and security. Even with large elements, the elegant design of SOFTLINE 82 AD offers narrow face widths and generous glazed areas for both modern architecture and stylish renovations.

SOFTLINE 82 AD is equipped with a stop seal on two sealing levels - for excellent wind tightness, optimum protection against driving rain and high sound insulation.
