The SOFTLINE 82 MD profile system can be used to produce particularly high-performance modern PVC-U windows that optimize the energy balance of any building - from low-energy houses to passive houses. They combine outstanding energy-saving properties with extreme durability, stability and security. Even with large elements, the elegant design of SOFTLINE 82 MD offers narrow face widths and generous glass surfaces.

SOFTLINE 82 MD is equipped with a center seal: Three sealing levels reliably keep out noise, cold, moisture and draughts and, together with the innovative multi-chamber geometry, ensure the best insulation values.

## Technical Details

1. **The particularly deep glass recess**: with 28 mm glazing rebate height for optimum isothermal flow prevents, among other things, the formation of unwanted condensation on the inside
2. **Large, perfectly fitted steel reinforcements**: contribute significantly to structural safety, load transfer and dimensional stability, thus ensuring many years of functional safety and strong burglar resistance
3. **The classic design**: with elegant shapes, slightly rounded edges and narrow face widths blends harmoniously into any architectural style
4. **Center seal system**: with 3 sealing levels for excellent wind tightness, best protection against driving rain and high sound insulation up to sound insulation class 5
5. **Highest VEKA quality**: Class A profile in accordance with DIN EN 12608 with an outer wall thickness of 3 mm and 2.7 mm walls in the rebate and connection area (tolerance ±0.2 mm in each case)
6. **82 mm basic installation depth**: ideal for effective thermal insulation, universally applicable for new builds and renovations
7. **Highly insulating multi-chamber geometry**: for maximum energy efficiency and the best Uw thermal insulation values up to Uw = 0.74 W/(m2K) [with Uf = 1.0 W/(m2K), Ug = 0.5 W/(m2K), ψg = 0.03 W/(mK)]
